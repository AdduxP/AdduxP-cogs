# AdduxP-cogs
A stupid Cog repo made with Red (the bot) in mind. Some are useful, some are useless, and some are just downright stupid. One of them might even be a panini in disguise.

To be used with the in-bot downloader by adding it with:  
`!cog repo add AdduxP-cogs https://github.com/AdduxP/AdduxP-cogs`


###chat
`!chat [text]` or `@[Mention] [text]` to chat with the bot.
`!chat toggle` to turn @mention replying on/off

###remindme
`!remindme <quantity> <time_unit> <text>` sends you `<text>` when the time is up.
